# docker-bottle-mongo

I'll be doing this course using two docker containers: one for the bottle app, one for MongoDB. The upside is that I'm not messing with my system installations. The downside is that the homework assignments might be inconvenient to complete on this setup. To do the homeworks I'll be using a `conda` [environment](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html).
